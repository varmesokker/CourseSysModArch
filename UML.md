## UML Concept areas

### Static structure
Any precise model must first define the universe of discourse, that is, the key concepts from the application, they internal porperties, and their relationships to each other. 
This group of constructs is the static view.

Application concepts are modeled as classes, each of which describe discrete objects that hold information and communicate to implement behaviour. 

The information they hols is modeled as attributes; the behaviour is modeled as operations.

A child class adds incremental structure and behaviour to their common structure.

### Design constructs
UML models are meant for both logical analysis and designs intended for implementation. 
A structured classifier expands a class into its implementation as a collection of parts held together by connectors. 

A class can encapsulate its internal strucutre behinds externally visible ports

### Deployment constructs
A node is a run-time computing resource that defines a location. 
Artifacts are deployed on nodes. An artifact can be a manifestation, an implementation of a component.


### Dynamic behaviour
Three ways to model behaviour
- Model by life history of how it interacts with the rest of the world
- Communication patterns of a set of connected objects
- Evolution of the execution process


The view of an object in isolation is a state machines
