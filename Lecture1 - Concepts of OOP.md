## What is object oriented programming?

A concept in which you program. Relies on classes and and objects which inherit from classes.
By having objects inherit base structure from classes you minimize duplicate work.

## What are the basic concepts of OOP?
Data
- How to store data in objects

Objects

Shift logic from writing pipeline of data to how can the methods be manipulated. 

Manipulating the data rather than writing the code itself. "How do I want to manipulate this piece of data?". Extract the most generic parts of data

## What are the main principles of OOP?

See below

## What are the advantages of OOP?

Low repeatable operations to manipulate massive amounts of data
Code-reusability. Therefore it increases the scalability of the code

Reduced complexity of code.

## Encapsulation

Encapsulation is...
- Bundling
	- Create a class

Types of encapsulation
- Public
	- 
- Private
	- Protects methods from being affected by out-of-class objects
	- Cannot be inherited
- Protected
	- Can be inherited

Data hiding is also encapsulation

We use ecapsulation to protect data from being manipulated or accessed from other classes.
For example safety issues or security.
It also increases the readability

```python

class Employee
	def __init__(self, name, project):
		self.name = name
		self.project = project
	def working(self):
		print(self.name, "working on", self.project)	

```

```python
def __init__
	#_ within sub
	# __ accessible within own clas only
```

## Abstraction

Abstraction is...

## Inheritance

Inheritance is...

## Polymorphism

Polymorphism is...



#  Modern software intensive system

  

  

  

  

Data-streaming -> Netflix

  

  

  

  

## Difference between system and software

  

A system can involve multiple softwares

  

## Reusable software

  

"R**eusability** is the use of existing _assets_ in some form within the [software product development process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development_process "Software development process")"
