## What is UML

UML - Unified Modeling Language

Made to communicate across disciplines

It does not solely have to be used in programming, it is usable in general project design

UML is a general purpose modeling language
- Visual modeling language


Made to specify, visualize, construct, and document the artifacts of a software language



The possible risk created by software failure defines whether there is a standard to follow or not


### Is it enforced?

UML was developed in an effort to simplify and consolidate the large number of object-oriented development methods that had merge

An effort to unify concept methods for boooks on OOP methology


## Object Management Group

In 1996 the OBject Management Group issued a request for proposal for a standard approach to object-oriented modeling which was standarized in 1997



### Benefits of UML

Readability
Easier to re-understand
Readable across disciplines


### Types of UML Diagrams

14 types of UML diagrams

2 families of UML diagrams

Structural UML diagrams
- Class diagrams
- Object diagrams
- Package diagrams
- Componen diagrams
- Composite structure diagrams
- Profile diagarms


Behavioural UML Diagrams
- Use diagrams
- Activity diagrams
- Sequence diagrams
- State diagrams
- Communication diagrams
- Interaction overview diagrams
- Timing diagrams


### UML Objectives

UML is not intended to be a complete debelopment method. It does not include a step-by-step development process



## Complexity of UML

UML is a product of consensus of persons with varied goals and interests. It shares the qualities of the product of a democratic process

It is not as clean or coherent as the product of a single will

It contains superfluous features

It contains overlapping features that are not always well integrated. Most of all, it lacks a consistent viewpoint

Unlike a programming language -which is fairly narrow- UML is intended for business to be readable. It has to be understandable on a general level

There is a tension between concepts for ceptual modeling and programming language representation, with no consistent guidelines


It is unnecessary to listen to too much UML language lawyers. There is no single right way to use it



### More than visual notation

UML models can be used to generate code and test cases

## OO Analysis and Design

Waterfall model
- Based on developing the entire model based on assumptions

1. Identify objects

2. Define relationships

3. Establish interface

4. Making design executable
